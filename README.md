# Neurobiology Practical Course on EEG Experiment Conduction and Analysis

Welcome to the Neurobiology Practical Course on EEG Experiment Conduction and Analysis! This repository contains all the materials you'll need to complete the course, including lab manuals, data sets, and analysis scripts.

## Description

The Neurobiology Practical Course on EEG Experiment Conduction and Analysis is a hands-on course designed to teach students how to conduct and analyze EEG experiments. Through a combination of lectures and lab sessions, students will learn the fundamentals of EEG, including electrode placement, data collection, and signal processing. They will also learn how to use software tools for data analysis, including MATLAB and EEGLAB.
Course Structure

### The course is divided into X parts:

**Introduction to EEG:** In this part, students will learn the basic principles of EEG and how to set up an EEG experiment.

**Data Collection and Processing:** In this part, students will learn how to collect EEG data and process it using software tools like MATLAB and EEGLAB.

**Data Analysis and Interpretation:** In this part, students will learn how to analyze EEG data and interpret their findings.

## Prerequisites

To take this course, students should have a basic understanding of neurobiology and statistics. They should also have some programming experience, preferably with MATLAB.
Installation
