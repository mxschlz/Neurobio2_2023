# Neurobiology Practical Course on EEG Experiment Conduction and Analysis

Welcome to the Neurobiology Practical Course on EEG Experiment Conduction and Analysis! This repository contains all the materials you'll need to complete the course, including lab manuals, data sets, and analysis scripts.

## Description

The Neurobiology Practical Course on EEG Experiment Conduction and Analysis is a hands-on course designed to teach students how to conduct and analyze EEG experiments. Through a combination of lectures and lab sessions, students will learn the fundamentals of EEG, including electrode placement, data collection, and signal processing. They will also learn how to use software tools for data analysis via [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html).

## Course Structure

### The course is divided into three weeks:

**1. Introduction to MNE-Python:** In this week, students will learn the basic principles of EEG data analysis and how to set up an EEG experiment. We will also focus on theory behind the experiment designs.

**2. Data Collection and Processing:** In this week, students will learn how to collect EEG data and process it using software tools like MNE-Python.

**3. Data Analysis and Interpretation:** In this week, students will learn how to analyze EEG data and interpret their findings. On the last day, every group will hold a presentation about what they did over the course of the three weeks.

## Prerequisites

To take this course, students should have a basic understanding of neurobiology and data analysis. They should also have some programming experience, preferably with Python.

## Installation

To access the materials for this course, simply clone this repository to your local machine:


` git clone https://github.com/mxschlz/neurobio2_2023.git
`

## Usage

The materials for this course are organized into three directories, one for each part of the course. Each directory contains a lab manual, data sets, and analysis scripts. To get started, simply read through the lab manual for the first part of the course and follow the instructions. The lab manual will guide you through the steps necessary to complete each lab session.
